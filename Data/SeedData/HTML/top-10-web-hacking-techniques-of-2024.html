    <h1 class="heading-orange-1">Top 10 web hacking techniques of 2024</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Top 10 Web Hacking Techniques of 2024, the <a
            href="https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques">18th edition</a> of our annual
        community-powered effort to identify the most innovative must-read web security research published in the last
        year.</p>
    <p>This post is the culmination of a three-step collaboration with the security community. Over the last month:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The community <a
                href="https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2024-nominations-open">submitted
                nominations</a> for the top research from 2024</li>
        <li>The community voted on those nominations to build a shortlist of the top 15</li>
        <li>An expert panel voted on the shortlist to select and order the 10 finalists</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This year, the community nominated a staggering 121 pieces of research - nearly double what we saw last time. To
        make the number of options in the community vote manageable, I filtered out entries consisting of articles
        published outside 2024 or outside the scope of <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/application-security-testing">web application
            security</a>, and writeups that, while valuable, were not innovative. Even after this filter, there were 103
        entries remaining! </p>
    <p>After the community vote, we were honoured to see the top fifteen included three techniques by PortSwigger
        Research. To avoid risking a repeat of last year, I excluded these from the panel vote. Of course, we are still
        very proud of them, and you can read them here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://portswigger.net/research/gotta-cache-em-all">Gotta cache 'em all: bending the rules of web
                cache exploitation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://portswigger.net/research/splitting-the-email-atom">Splitting the email atom: exploiting
                parsers to bypass access controls</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://portswigger.net/research/listen-to-the-whispers-web-timing-attacks-that-actually-work">Listen
                to the whispers: web timing attacks that actually work</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The fifteen finalists from the community vote were then analyzed and voted on by an expert panel consisting of <a
            href="https://bsky.app/profile/agarri.fr">Nicolas Grégoire</a>, <a
            href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/sdalili">Soroush Dalili</a>, <a href="https://x.com/stokfredrik/">STÖK</a>,
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liveoverflow">Fabian (LiveOverflow)</a>, and <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-kettle-albinowax/">myself</a>.</p>
    <p>This year, a single theme dominated the top five - you might be able to guess what it was.
    </p>

    <p>Let's begin the countdown!</p>

    <h4>10. Hijacking OAuth flows via Cookie Tossing</h4>
    <p>In tenth place, <a href="https://snyk.io/articles/hijacking-oauth-flows-via-cookie-tossing/">Hijacking OAuth
            flows via Cookie Tossing</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliot-w-27962779/">Elliot Ward</a>
        introduces a novel application of the widely under-estimated Cookie Tossing technique. This research was
        directly inspired by <a href="https://www.thomashouhou.com/post/cookie-tossing-attacks">an earlier post</a> by
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-houhou/">Thomas Houhou</a></p>
    <p>Both articles are essential reading, especially if you ever find yourself stuck with a self-XSS, or XSS in an
        inconsequential subdomain. Cookies predate the <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/same-origin-policy">Same-Origin
            Policy</a> that governs JavaScript, and this research shows that in spite of decades of security-bodges from
        HttpOnly to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/bypassing-samesite-restrictions">SameSite</a>, they're still a hazard.
        Maybe it would be safer just to use localStorage for session tokens instead.</p>
    <h4>9. ChatGPT Account Takeover - Wildcard Web Cache Deception</h4>
    <p><a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-deception">Web Cache Deception</a> originally debuted at #2 in the <a
            href="https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2017">top web hacking techniques of
            2017</a>, and has recently seen rapid development.</p>
    <p>In <a href="https://nokline.github.io/bugbounty/2024/02/04/ChatGPT-ATO.html">ChatGPT Account Takeover - Wildcard
            Web Cache Deception</a>, <a href="https://x.com/h4r3l">Harel</a> introduces a twist on the technique,
        exploiting inconsistent decoding to perform <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal">path traversal</a> and
        escape a cache rule's intended scope. We built a Web Security Academy lab based on this technique, so you can <a
            href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-deception/lab-wcd-exploiting-origin-server-normalization">try
            it out for yourself</a>.
    </p>

    <p>We highly recommend reading all the author's writeups - they were a fundamental inspiration for our own web cache
        deception research.</p>

    <h4>8. OAuth Non-Happy Path to ATO</h4>
    <p>In position 8, <a href="https://blog.voorivex.team/oauth-non-happy-path-to-ato">OAuth Non-Happy Path to ATO</a>
        by <a href="https://x.com/omidxrz">Oxrz</a> articulates the thought process behind a beautiful and innovative
        attack chain. STÖK perfectly captured why this research stands out:</p>


    <blockquote>I just love how something as seemingly benign as an app honoring a manipulated "Referer:" header can
        turn into a full-blown account takeover via OAuth. This chain perfectly demonstrates how inspiration from prior
        research (in this case, <a href="https://x.com/fransrosen">Frans Rosén's</a> almost legendary <a
            href="https://labs.detectify.com/writeups/account-hijacking-using-dirty-dancing-in-sign-in-oauth-flows/">Dirty
            Dancing</a> write-up) combined with a deep dive into the OAuth documentation can lead to some seriously
        creative attack chains. I had completely forgotten about this attack flow, but there’s no way I’m not automating
        checks for referer-based redirects whenever I’m poking at stuff from now on!</blockquote>


    <h4>7. CVE-2024-4367 - Arbitrary JavaScript execution in PDF.js</h4>
    <p>In seventh place, we've got... a CVE! <a
            href="https://codeanlabs.com/blog/research/cve-2024-4367-arbitrary-js-execution-in-pdf-js/">CVE-2024-4367 -
            Arbitrary JavaScript execution in PDF.js</a> to be precise. It's rare that a single, patched vulnerability
        makes its way into the top ten, but this finding by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasrinsma/">Thomas
            Rinsma</a> is exceptional. PDF.js is widely embedded as a library, making the second-order impact both huge
        and difficult to predict. This research is a quality analysis of some severely overlooked attack surface, and
        undermines assumptions about where an attacker might get a foothold.</p>
    <p>If you enjoy PDF shenanigans like this, we highly recommend reviewing publications by <a
            href="https://x.com/insertScript">Alex Inführ</a> &amp; <a href="https://x.com/corkami">Ange Albertini</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>6. DoubleClickjacking: A New Era of UI Redressing</h4>
    <p><a href="https://www.paulosyibelo.com/2024/12/doubleclickjacking-what.html">DoubleClickjacking: A New Era of UI
            Redressing</a> introduces a variation on Clickjacking that bypasses pretty much every known mitigation. This
        entry proved controversial with the panel because it seems simple and deceptively obvious in retrospect, but
        still came in highly placed due to raw, undeniable value.</p>
    <p>While glimmers of this attack concept have existed for years, <a href="https://x.com/PaulosYibelo">Paulos
            Yibelo</a> delivers it with a perfect execution that proves it's unequivocally the right time for this
        attack. Framing restrictions and SameSite cookies have largely killed Clickjacking, and browser performance has
        achieved a level that makes the sleight of hand pretty much invisible. Love it, hate it, or simply hate the fact
        that you didn't discover it first, this is not a technique to ignore!</p>
    <h4>5. Exploring the DOMPurify library: Bypasses and Fixes</h4>
    <p>HTML sanitisation has been an XSS battleground for decades, and the DOMPurify library by Cure53 has emerged as
        pretty much the only defensive solution that actually works.</p>
    <p><a href="https://mizu.re/post/exploring-the-dompurify-library-bypasses-and-fixes">Exploring the DOMPurify
            library: Bypasses and Fixes</a> dives deep into browser HTML-parsing internals, discovering and applying
        novel mutation XSS (mXSS) primitives. Described by LiveOverflow as "An absolute joy to read" and "Probably the
        most comprehensive article for understanding mXSS and how this affects sanitizers such as DOMPurify", this is a
        must-read for anyone into JavaScript and XSS, and will serve as a manual for anyone looking to develop a HTML
        sanitisation bypass for years to come.</p>


    <p>Awesome work by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mizu.re">Mizu</a>.</p>

    <h4>4. WorstFit: Unveiling Hidden Transformers in Windows ANSI</h4>
    <p>Everyone 'knows' that charset conversion is an absolute minefield, and yet somehow it's rarely seen in real
        exploits. In <a
            href="https://blog.orange.tw/posts/2025-01-worstfit-unveiling-hidden-transformers-in-windows-ansi/">WorstFit:
            Unveiling Hidden Transformers in Windows ANSI</a>, <a href="https://x.com/orange_8361">Orange Tsai</a> and
        <a href="https://x.com/_splitline_">splitline</a> prove the true power of this attack class, racking up numerous
        CVEs and triggering a vendor blame-game in the process. It's always a sign of great research when something that
        seems like it should be fundamental platform knowledge pops up and takes everyone by surprise.</p>

    <p>We expect to see more discoveries in this area, and after catching this talk live at Black Hat Europe I pushed
        automatic detection of WorstFit-style transformations into ActiveScan++ to help out. STÖK spotted the <a
            href="https://worst.fit/mapping/">WorstFit mapping explorer</a> is an absolute gem for generating fuzzing
        wordlists, too.</p>
    <h3>3. Unveiling TE.0 HTTP Request Smuggling</h3>
    <p>The community's understanding of request smuggling is still rapidly evolving, and <a
            href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/blog/unveiling-te-0-http-request-smuggling-discovering-a-critical-vulnerability-in-thousands-of-google-cloud-websites/">Unveiling
            TE.0 HTTP Request Smuggling: Discovering a Critical Vulnerability in Thousands of Google Cloud Websites</a>
        is a major, must-read contribution by <a href="https://x.com/sw33tLie">Paolo Arnolfo</a>, <a
            href="https://x.com/bsysop">Guillermo Gregorio</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/_medusa_1_">@_medusa_1_</a>
    </p>
    <p>This research is personally significant for me as it taught me an important lesson. Back when I first encountered
        CL.0 request smuggling, I hypothesized that TE.0 could exist but that it would never be exploitable, as it would
        require the back-end server to accept a HTTP request starting with a number and a newline. I was very, very,
        wrong. Once you've mastered the fundamentals, if you want to push the boundaries, relying on prediction and
        analysis can hold you back. If you don't ask the question because you think you know the answer, you stay
        ignorant.</p>
    <p>If you're wondering how the attack actually works, my best guess is that the front-end was rewriting the body as
        non-chunked, but forgetting to set the Content-Length header due to the OPTIONS method. This is an insane
        finding which opens the door to a whole lot of possibilities. Watch this space.</p>
    <h3>2. SQL Injection Isn't Dead: Smuggling Queries at the Protocol Level</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you can tell research is going to be amazing just from the subtitle. LiveOverflow has a great analysis:
    </p>
    <blockquote>"Great research progress often happens at the intersection of fields. In <a
            href="https://x.com/pspaul95">Paul Gerste's</a> <a
            href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2032/DEF%20CON%2032%20presentations/DEF%20CON%2032%20-%20Paul%20Gerste%20-%20SQL%20Injection%20Isn%27t%20Dead%20Smuggling%20Queries%20at%20the%20Protocol%20Level.pdf">SQL
            Injection Isn't Dead Smuggling Queries at the Protocol Level</a> we can see binary memory corruption ideas
        being applied to the world of web hacking. We have an integer overflow that corrupts a size, and basically a
        heap-spray technique to hit a fake Query more reliably... beautiful."</blockquote>

    <p>It's a testament to how strong the competition was this year that this didn't grab first place.</p>
    <h3>1. Confusion Attacks: Exploiting Hidden Semantic Ambiguity in Apache HTTP Server</h3>
    <p><a href="https://x.com/orange_8361">Orange Tsai</a> has claimed the #1 position for the third time with <a
            href="https://blog.orange.tw/posts/2024-08-confusion-attacks-en/">Confusion Attacks: Exploiting Hidden
            Semantic Ambiguity in Apache HTTP Server</a>. This inspiring, deep and impactful research publication left
        the entire panel in awe. Here's what they had to say: </p>
    <blockquote>Once again, some fantastic research by Orange! It's crazy nobody considered approaching Apache in this
        way before! - Nicolas</blockquote>

    <blockquote>I’m certain we’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible by building on this research. Can’t
        wait to dig deeper, hunt for fingerprints and indicators of confusions and when the time is right, go all
        brrrrrr! - STÖK</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Orange Tsai treats Apache httpd like a web CTF challenge! It's incredible how deep and impactful
        Orange's research (always) is. Given the popularity of httpd, this research will serve as a reference for
        security practitioners for a long time. - LiveOverflow</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Orange is confusing all the apps! - Soroush</blockquote>

    <p>This is incredible, must-read research and absolutely deserves top place. Congratulations Orange!</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>The security community published a record-breaking amount of high-quality research in 2024, leading to intense
        competition for both the community and panel votes. This wasn't just a matter of quantity - this was the highest
        quality crop of research I've seen since picking up the top ten project in 2018, and if the trend continues next
        near it's going to cause carnage. With 103 nominations and only ten spots, many great writeups didn't make the
        cut, so be sure to check out the <a
            href="https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2024-nominations-open">full
            nomination list</a> and let us know what your #1 was. Also, if you spotted some exceptional research from
        2024 that never got nominated, chuck me an email and I'll add it to the list.</p>
    <p>Part of what lands an entry in the top 10 is its expected longevity, so it's well worth getting caught up with <a
            href="https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques">the top ten archive</a> too. If you're
        interested in getting a preview of what might win from 2025, you can <a

            href="https://discord.gg/tDtgSMjqsc">our Discord</a>, or follow us on social. If you're interested in doing
        this kind of research yourself, I've shared a few lessons I've learned over the years in <a
            href="https://portswigger.net/research/hunting-evasive-vulnerabilities">Hunting Evasive Vulnerabilities</a>,

            security researcher?</a></p>
    <p>Massive thanks to the panel for contributing their time and expertise to curating the final result, and thanks
        also to everyone who took part! Without your nominations, votes, and most-importantly research, this wouldn't be
        possible.</p>
    <p>Till next time!</p>
